Currently you have to edit the source files to make changes in the generated terrain.

You need to open the main.Main source java file and follow the instructions there.

For more detailed info on what each parameter does see main.MyzoGEN source file.

I will implement some sort of user interface in the near future (probably a config file) but for now - 
you have to edit the source file. Sorry for the inconvenience :(

NOTE: The newest source is always in source - eclipse project folder. MyzoGEN-x.x-source.jar contains the last stable code.
